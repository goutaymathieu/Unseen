# Unseen
In the game, the goal is to find the exit in a totally black world, but we don’t know where it is. 
We embody a character, walking in dark rooms. We see this character from above and to orientate us, the walk makes noise, and this noise is shown by straight white line. As the physic course taught us, the sound is a mechanical wave, which reflects on surface. 
As the goal is to find the exit, the world is seen from above, and there’s a corridor from the place we start to the end. So the sound reflects on the walls, and help us see how the design of the world is. We can see where the exit is thanks to a change of color, or shape, of the ray.  

There will be two kinds of walk: 
The loud one, with which we can see far away. But with this kind of walk, the enemies can “hear” us, and “shout” back to us. If their sound, represented by red rays, touches us, we die.
The silent one, with which we can only see much closer, but with this kind of walk, enemies cannot hear us. However, if we really touch (get really close to) the enemies, we die.  

We have in mind some extra features which could be nice to the gameplay. There’s could be change of media like water which would turn the rays from white to blue, and which would slow down the character. 
Also, the character would be able to “shout”, or “clap”, to make a big noise, which would make longer lines.
We could also add gap, where the character would fall, and which would be represented by yellow lines.
